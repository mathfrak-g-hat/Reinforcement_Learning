      "\n",
      "class LunarLander(gym.core.Env, gym.utils.ezpickle.EzPickle)\n",
      " |  LunarLander(*args, **kwds)\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  ### Description\n",
      " |  This environment is a classic rocket trajectory optimization problem.\n",
      " |  According to Pontryagin's maximum principle, it is optimal to fire the\n",
      " |  engine at full throttle or turn it off. This is the reason why this\n",
      " |  environment has discrete actions: engine on or off.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  There are two environment versions: discrete or continuous.\n",
      " |  The landing pad is always at coordinates (0,0). The coordinates are the\n",
      " |  first two numbers in the state vector.\n",
      " |  Landing outside of the landing pad is possible. Fuel is infinite, so an agent\n",
      " |  can learn to fly and then land on its first attempt.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  To see a heuristic landing, run:\n",
      " |  ```\n",
      " |  python gym/envs/box2d/lunar_lander.py\n",
      " |  ```\n",
      " |  <!-- To play yourself, run: -->\n",
      " |  <!-- python examples/agents/keyboard_agent.py LunarLander-v2 -->\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  ### Action Space\n",
      " |  There are four discrete actions available: do nothing, fire left\n",
      " |  orientation engine, fire main engine, fire right orientation engine.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  ### Observation Space\n",
      " |  There are 8 states: the coordinates of the lander in `x` & `y`, its linear\n",
      " |  velocities in `x` & `y`, its angle, its angular velocity, and two booleans\n",
      " |  that represent whether each leg is in contact with the ground or not.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  ### Rewards\n",
      " |  Reward for moving from the top of the screen to the landing pad and coming\n",
      " |  to rest is about 100-140 points.\n",
      " |  If the lander moves away from the landing pad, it loses reward.\n",
      " |  If the lander crashes, it receives an additional -100 points. If it comes\n",
      " |  to rest, it receives an additional +100 points. Each leg with ground\n",
      " |  contact is +10 points.\n",
      " |  Firing the main engine is -0.3 points each frame. Firing the side engine\n",
      " |  is -0.03 points each frame. Solved is 200 points.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  ### Starting State\n",
      " |  The lander starts at the top center of the viewport with a random initial\n",
      " |  force applied to its center of mass.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  ### Episode Termination\n",
      " |  The episode finishes if:\n",
      " |  1) the lander crashes (the lander body gets in contact with the moon);\n",
      " |  2) the lander gets outside of the viewport (`x` coordinate is greater than 1);\n",
      " |  3) the lander is not awake. From the [Box2D docs](https://box2d.org/documentation/md__d_1__git_hub_box2d_docs_dynamics.html#autotoc_md61),\n",
      " |      a body which is not awake is a body which doesn't move and doesn't\n",
      " |      collide with any other body:\n",
      " |  > When Box2D determines that a body (or group of bodies) has come to rest,\n",
      " |  > the body enters a sleep state which has very little CPU overhead. If a\n",
      " |  > body is awake and collides with a sleeping body, then the sleeping body\n",
      " |  > wakes up. Bodies will also wake up if a joint or contact attached to\n",
      " |  > them is destroyed.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  ### Arguments\n",
      " |  To use to the _continuous_ environment, you need to specify the\n",
      " |  `continuous=True` argument like below:\n",
      " |  ```python\n",
      " |  import gym\n",
      " |  env = gym.make(\"LunarLander-v2\", continuous=True)\n",
      " |  ```\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  ### Version History\n",
      " |  - v2: Count energy spent\n",
      " |  - v1: Legs contact with ground added in state vector; contact with ground\n",
      " |      give +10 reward points, and -10 if then lose contact; reward\n",
      " |      renormalized to 200; harder initial random push.\n",
      " |  - v0: Initial version\n",
      " |  \n",
